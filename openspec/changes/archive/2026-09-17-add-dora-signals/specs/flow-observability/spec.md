# flow-observability Specification Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Flow signals per repository and in aggregate

The projection SHALL provide reads for cycle time and wait time distributions, the unmerged queue (count
and age), batch size (files, lines, and commits per change), merge frequency per day, rework (a change
touching files a change within the configured window also touched), escapes (a revert, or a change carrying
`fix` in its subject that touches files of a change in the most recent release, after that release's tag),
local check outcomes per change, and spend (tokens and cost) per change, per unmerged pull request, per
spec reference, per provider, and per model, computed separately for each enabled effort unit where a unit
applies. It SHALL also provide the four DORA reads approximated to the release tag, each carrying a note
naming the approximation: deployment frequency as releases per week over the measured window, citing the
tags; lead time for changes as the interval from a change's first commit to the release tag that carried it,
with the merge-to-tag interval reported separately and unreleased changes excluded by reason; change
failure rate as escapes divided by releases in the window, with the denominator stated; and time to fix as
the interval from the merge of the released change an escape targets, resolved by shared files, to the
merge of the escape. It SHALL provide weekly trends of changes merged and session cost over the measured
window, spend by cost class (`rd`, `production`, `unclassified`, taken from the session's cost class, then
the change's `Cost-Class:` trailer, never defaulted), and coverage counts of changes with an agent session,
human-only, undeclared, and unreported. Each read SHALL be available per repository and across the
registry, SHALL state the trust classes it included and the number of changes excluded for lacking what it
needs, and SHALL raise a signal when a registered threshold is exceeded, naming the threshold and the
changes behind it. Spend per unmerged pull request SHALL cite every session record of that pull request,
including the records excluded from its figures. No read SHALL be keyed to a person, and the projection
SHALL NOT offer a person as a dimension.

#### Scenario: A wait-time threshold raises a signal

- GIVEN a registry entry with a wait-time threshold of two days and a period in which three changes waited
  longer
- WHEN the flow reads are computed
- THEN a signal MUST name the threshold and cite the three changes

#### Scenario: Cost per unit of effort excludes what it cannot measure

- GIVEN five changes of which two recorded story points
- WHEN cost per story point is requested
- THEN the result MUST be computed over those two only
- AND it MUST report that three changes were excluded for lacking the unit

#### Scenario: Cost is attributable per provider

- GIVEN changes carrying session records from two different coding-agent providers
- WHEN cost per provider is requested
- THEN each provider's tokens and cost MUST be reported separately
- AND their sum MUST equal the total reported cost

#### Scenario: Spend is attributable to one unmerged pull request

- GIVEN an unmerged pull request with two session records, one carrying figures and one carrying
  `figuresMissing`
- WHEN spend per unmerged pull request is requested
- THEN that pull request's figures MUST be computed from the first record only
- AND it MUST report one record excluded for missing figures
- AND it MUST cite both records

#### Scenario: No signal is keyed to a person

- GIVEN a projection whose session records carry operator identifiers
- WHEN any flow read is listed
- THEN none MUST group, rank, or trend a figure by operator identifier

#### Scenario: Deployment frequency counts release tags and says so

- GIVEN two release tags fourteen days apart
- WHEN the DORA reads are computed
- THEN deployment frequency MUST report one release per week citing both tags
- AND its note MUST state that releases stand in for deployments

#### Scenario: Lead time runs to the tag and excludes unreleased work

- GIVEN a change merged and carried by a later release tag, and a change merged after the newest tag
- WHEN lead time to release is computed
- THEN the first change's value MUST be the interval from its first commit to that tag
- AND the second change MUST be excluded with the reason `unreleased`

#### Scenario: Change failure rate states its denominator

- GIVEN two releases and one escape after the newest
- WHEN change failure rate is computed
- THEN it MUST report 0.5 escapes per release over 2 releases citing the escape

#### Scenario: Time to fix runs from the targeted change's merge

- GIVEN a released change and a later `fix` change touching one of its files
- WHEN time to fix is computed
- THEN its value MUST be the interval between the two merges
- AND it MUST cite the fix and the change it targets

#### Scenario: Spend by cost class is never defaulted

- GIVEN a change carrying `Cost-Class: production` with two sessions, one carrying its own class `rd`, and a
  change with no class anywhere
- WHEN spend by cost class is computed
- THEN the `rd` session's figures MUST be under `rd`, the other under `production`, and the unclassed change
  under `unclassified`

### Requirement: The Board

The system SHALL provide one read surface, The Board, rendering the projection per repository and across the
registry: the flow signals and any thresholds exceeded, spend per spec reference, per provider, and per
model, cost per unit of recorded effort, the unmerged queue, undeclared, unreported, and out-of-band changes,
and unreachable repositories. Every figure SHALL show the trust classes it was computed from and its excluded
count, and SHALL be traceable to the changes and records it was computed from. The Board SHALL NOT present
any figure keyed to an operator identifier, SHALL read only from the projection, and SHALL render an explicit
empty state when the projection has no records. The Board SHALL be available as a terminal render and as a
static HTML dashboard written by `telemetry board --html`: one self-contained page with inline styles and
inline SVG, containing no script element and loading no external resource, readable from a file URL, laid out
per repository with each figure's trust classes and excluded count beside it and its citations expandable
beneath it, working in light and dark color schemes and at phone width. On the HTML dashboard every cited
commit SHALL render as its abbreviated hash beside the change's subject, and SHALL link to that commit on the
hosting platform when the repository's web URL is recorded; a cited pull request SHALL link to that pull
request and a cited session record to that file on the default branch. A hyperlink to the hosting platform is
navigation and SHALL NOT be treated as an external resource; when no web URL is recorded the same text SHALL
render with no hyperlink. On the HTML dashboard the unmerged queue SHALL show each pull request's spend beside its age, and the recent-changes table SHALL show each change's spend, each rendering what the records say rather than a zero when figures are missing, with every session record cited. The Board SHALL show the four DORA
reads as a strip of cards, each with its approximation note and its citations, a spend-over-time chart with
the same weekly buckets as merge activity, a spend-by-cost-class panel, and the coverage counts, on both the
HTML dashboard and the terminal render.

#### Scenario: The Board with an empty projection

- GIVEN a projection with no records
- WHEN an operator opens The Board
- THEN it MUST render with an explicit empty state rather than failing

#### Scenario: A figure enumerates its inputs

- GIVEN a panel showing cost for a spec reference
- WHEN an operator inspects the figure
- THEN it MUST list the changes and session records that produced it

#### Scenario: The Board shows no per-operator figure

- GIVEN a projection whose session records carry operator identifiers
- WHEN an operator opens The Board
- THEN no panel MUST group, rank, or trend any figure by operator identifier

#### Scenario: The dashboard is one self-contained page

- GIVEN a projection with records
- WHEN `telemetry board --html` runs
- THEN it MUST write one HTML file that contains no script element, no stylesheet or resource reference, and
  no style rule loading a resource
- AND opening that file from a file URL MUST show every panel with its trust classes, excluded count, and
  citations without a network request

#### Scenario: The dashboard renders in both color schemes and at phone width

- GIVEN the written page
- WHEN it is viewed with a dark color scheme, or in a viewport 400 pixels wide
- THEN every panel MUST remain readable with its figures and citations visible

#### Scenario: A cited commit names its change and reaches the platform

- GIVEN a repository whose registry URL is a GitHub remote and a panel citing a change
- WHEN an operator expands that panel's citations
- THEN each citation MUST show the abbreviated hash and that change's subject
- AND the hash MUST link to that commit under the repository's web URL

#### Scenario: A repository with no web URL renders the same citations unlinked

- GIVEN a repository whose registry URL is a local path
- WHEN the dashboard is rendered
- THEN its citations MUST still show the abbreviated hash and the change's subject
- AND the page MUST contain no hyperlink for that repository

#### Scenario: The queue shows what each pull request has cost

- GIVEN an unmerged pull request with a session record carrying figures
- WHEN an operator opens the dashboard
- THEN that pull request's row MUST show its cost, tokens, and session count
- AND the row MUST cite the session records behind them

#### Scenario: A pull request whose records carry no figures shows no cost

- GIVEN an unmerged pull request whose every session record carries `figuresMissing`
- WHEN an operator opens the dashboard
- THEN that pull request's row MUST say its figures are missing rather than showing a currency figure
- AND it MUST still cite those records

#### Scenario: A change with no declared session shows why, not a zero

- GIVEN a change on the default branch carrying no `Session:` trailer
- WHEN an operator opens the dashboard
- THEN that change's row in the recent-changes table MUST read `undeclared` in place of a spend figure

#### Scenario: The DORA strip names its approximations

- GIVEN a repository with release tags
- WHEN an operator opens the dashboard
- THEN four cards MUST show deployment frequency, lead time to release, change failure rate, and time to
  fix, each with a note naming the release tag as the approximation and each citing its tags or changes
